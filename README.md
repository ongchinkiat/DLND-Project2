# DLND-Project2 - Image Classification
Project 2 submission for Udacity Deep Learning Foundation Nanodegree

This project uses the CIFAR-10 dataset https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

Running this on a Quad core 2.4GHz CPU takes 8 min per epoch (more than 12 hours for a full training run).
Running this on Amazon AWS GPU takes less than 2 seconds per epoch. The performance difference is more than 250 times.

This is a small Neural Network model, taking up less than 4GB of RAM. So RAM size of your machine is not important.
